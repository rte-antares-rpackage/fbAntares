\title{Conversion of flow-based domains into an ANtares model with fixed PTDF}
\usage{
computeFB(PTDF = system.file("testdata/2019-07-18ptdfraw.csv", package =
  "fbAntares"), outputName = paste0(getwd(), "/antaresInput"),
  reports = TRUE, areaName = "cwe_at", areacsv = NULL,
  dayType = "All", hour = "All", clusteringDayType = "All",
  clusteringHours = "All", nbFaces = 75, verbose = 1,
  nbLines = 10000, maxiter = 10, thresholdIndic = 90, quad = F,

  seed = 123456)
}
\arguments{
\item{PTDF}{\code{character}, path leading to the flow-based domains (PTDF description) list. 
By default, this leads to an example file (\code{"PTDF.csv"}, saved in the package).
 This must be a csv file containing the following columns (and column names): 
\itemize{
 \item Id_day : numeric, name of each day. Default in example id_day between 1 and 12.
 \item Date : The date of the typical day 
 \item Period : numeric, hour of the day. Default in example period between 1 and 24 (1 is then between 00:00 and 01:00).
 \item ptdfBE : numeric, PTDF coefficient of Belgium.
 \item ptdfDE : numeric, PTDF coefficient of Germany. 
 \item ptdfFR : numeric, PTDF coefficient of France. 
 \item ptdfNL : numeric, PTDF coefficient of the Netherlands. 
 \item ptdfAT : numeric, PTDF coefficient of the Austria.
 \item more ptdf if needed 
 \item ram : numeric, remaining available capacity in the critical branch (MW). 
 \item Class : character, class of typical day (ex WinterSe) (not necessary)
 \item idDayType : numeric, name of each day. Default in example id_day between 1 and 12.
}}

\item{outputName}{\code{character}, path/name of the output directory. By default, the value is a created directory named 
"antaresInput" in the current directory}

\item{reports}{\code{boolean}, if TRUE, the function will write html reports (one per typical day). By default, the value is 
TRUE.}

\item{areaName}{\code{character} The name of the area of your study, possible values are
cwe_at (default), cwe and other. If you choose other, you have to give a csv file
which explains how your area work.}

\item{areacsv}{\code{character} file name of the csv you give if you chose
other for the areaName parameter.}

\item{dayType}{\code{numeric}, by default, the value is All. (optional) Vector of id_days to compute.}

\item{hour}{\code{numeric}, by default, the value is All. (optional) vector of hours/periods to compute.}

\item{clusteringDayType}{\code{numeric}, by default, the value is All. (optional) 
Typical days you want to choose for the faces selection.}

\item{clusteringHours}{\code{numeric}, by default, the value is All. (optional) 
Hours you want to choose for the faces selection.}

\item{nbFaces}{\code{numeric}, standard shape parameters: number of sides to select. By default, the value is 36.}

\item{verbose}{\code{numeric}, shows the logs in console. By default, the value is 1.
\itemize{
 \item 0 : No log
 \item 1 : Short log
 \item 2 : Medium log
}}

\item{nbLines}{\code{numeric}, number of halflines drawn for the distance computation, default 10 000}

\item{maxiter}{\code{numeric}, maximum number of iteration on the optimization problem, default 10}

\item{thresholdIndic}{\code{numeric}, minimum value of the validation indicator to stop, default 0.9
the optimization problem}

\item{quad}{\code{logical}, quadratic problem or linear, default FALSE}

\item{hubDrop}{\code{list}, list of hubs in the ptdf, with the ones which should
sustracted to the others as the names of the arrays which themself contain the ones which
be sustracted}

\item{fixFaces}{\code{data.table} data.table if you want to use fix faces for the creation
of the flowbased models. If you want to do it, the data.table has the following form :
data.table(func = c("min", "min", "max", "min"), zone = c("BE", "FR", "DE", "DE")).
func is the direction of the fix faces and zone is the area of this direction.
If you give for example min and DE, there will be a fix face at the minimum import
value of Germany.}

\item{seed}{\code{numeric}, value of the seed, default 123456}
}
\description{
This function follows two steps: based on the list of flow-based domains given in input, it will calculate a standard shape
 (selection of sides, k-medoid method) and will then project the real domains on this standard shape. The projection is 
computed using an optimisation algorithm aiming at minimising the volumetric error between the real domain and its projection.
 The function will then write in an output directory the standard shape (weights.txt), the projection result for each domain 
 (second_member.txt) and an RDS object storing information on the projection and the errors. Reports can be written represening the real and
modelled domains and the volumetric error between them.
