\title{Generate html report on a typical flow-based day}
\usage{
generateReportFb(dayType, output_file = NULL, countries = list(c("BE",
  "FR"), c("BE", "NL"), c("DE", "FR"), c("DE", "AT")), fb_opts = NULL,
  allFB = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dayType}{\code{numeric}, numerical id of the chosen typical flow-based days}

\item{output_file}{\code{character}, output directory of the html reports. 
By default, the value is \code{NULL}, the reports will be written in the current directory.}

\item{countries}{\code{list, character} a list of couples of countries to choose the axises for the projection
of the flowbased domains (ex : list(c("BE", "FR"), c("BE", "NL"))) or an array of countries
(ex : c("FR", "NL", "AT")) to project the domains on all the countries combination 
(here FR+NL, FR+AT and NL+AT)}

\item{fb_opts}{\code{list} of flowbased parameters (directory of the flow-based input) 
returned by the function \link{setFlowbasedPath}. By default, the value is 
indicated by \code{antaresFlowbased::fbOptions()}}

\item{allFB}{\code{data.table}, table of flow-based domains (real and modelled) 
returned by the function \link{computeFB}. By default, the value is \code{NULL}: 
in this case, the flow-based data is directly read in the model designated by 
the parameter fb_opts.}
}
\description{
This function generates an html report on one or several typical days, 
comparing the real and modelled domains. It hence can follow the use of the 
function \link{computeFB}. The report (one per day) is composed of several tabs: a 
summary of the volumetric errors (called inf and sup, representing real points 
forgotten in the model and modelled pointsmissing from the real domain) and 
plots for each hour of the real and modelled domains.
}
\examples{

\dontrun{
#Generate report for the typical day 7 of a model (already designated by setFlowBasedPath)
generateReportFb(dayType = 7, fb_opts = antaresFlowbased::fbOptions())

#Generate a report for the typical day 7 of a PTDF file
allFB <- computeFB(PTDF = "/path/PTDF_file.csv",reports = FALSE, dayType = 7)
generateReportFb(dayType = 7, fb_opts = antaresFlowbased::fbOptions(), allFB = allFB)
}
}
