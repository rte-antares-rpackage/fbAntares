\title{Evaluate the shared volume of two polyhedra A and B}
\usage{
evalInter(
  A,
  B,
  nbPoints = 50000,
  seed = 123456,
  draw_range = c(-15000, 15000),
  direction = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{\code{data.table}, fix polyhedron, data.table containing at least 
two ptdf columns :
\itemize{
 \item ptdfAT : autrichian vertices
 \item ptdfBE : belgium vertices
 \item ptdfDE : german vertices
 \item ptdfFR : french vertices
}}

\item{B}{\code{data.table}, moving polyhedron, data.table containing at least 
two ptdf columns :
\itemize{
 \item ptdfAT : autrichian vertices
 \item ptdfBE : belgium vertices
 \item ptdfDE : german vertices
 \item ptdfFR : french vertices
}}

\item{nbPoints}{\code{numeric}, number of points generated}

\item{seed}{\code{numeric} fixed random seed, used for the weighted draw of the 
typical days. By default, the value is 123456}

\item{draw_range}{The range in which the points for the volume assessment should be drawn}

\item{direction}{\code{data.table} used to provide specific directions in which
the comparison should be performed. The data table must contain two columns:
\itemize{
 \item a column "country" containing the names of the countries on which a direction is specified
 \item a column "direction" containing a string which can be either "positive" to specify that only
 positive net positions must be considered for this country, or "negative" if only negative net
 positions must be considered
}}
}
\description{
This function returns and indicator between 0 and 1 where 0 means
the intersection between A and B is empty and 1 means A == B.
Since there is no fast metric to compute the volume of a polyhedron in high 
dimension, this indicator is computed by generating n points in a n-dimensonal
space doing the ratio of the points in the two polyhedra and the points in
at least one of the polyhedra.

library(data.table)
polyhedra <- readRDS(system.file("testdata/polyhedra.rds", package = "fbAntares"))

B <- polyhedra[Date == "2019-02-15"]
nbPoints <- 50000

 evalInter(A = A, B = B, nbPoints = nbPoints)
